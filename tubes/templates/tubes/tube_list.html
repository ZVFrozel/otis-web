  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Click on the link above to access the problem proposals on Probase.
    After joining, you can submit problems and participate in testsolving.
  </p>
  <h3>Proposing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use "Add Problem" once you're in the Probase collection.</li>
    <li>
      Please make sure to provide a full solution and triple-check your answer
      for accuracy to avoid frustration for the testsolvers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please use a <strong>descriptive title</strong> that doesn't
      spoil the problem but gives an idea for what the problem is about.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Solving</h3>
  <p>
    There are five tiers of difficulty, and testsolvers get an amount of
    time per problem when testsolving it based on the tier:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AIME 1-3: Solvers get 10 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 4-6: Solvers get 15 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 7-9: Solvers get 20 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 10-12: Solvers get 25 minutes</li>
    <li>AIME 13-15: Solvers get 30 minutes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After you solve or give up on a proposal, you can read spoilers and comment
    on the thread for the problem. You can also upvote the problem using the heart
    icon to indicate that you like it.
  </p>
  <h2>Selection process</h2>
  <p>For now, final selection of problems and placements is done by Evan.</p>
  <p>The selection of problems are based on the following criteria.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Popularity</strong>: as evidenced by comments, upvotes,
      and Evan's own personal taste.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solution write-up</strong>: if the solution needs a lot of
      editing to be presentable (or worse, is just a sketch with no details),
      then the problem is less likely to be chosen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Solve rate</strong>: problems with too few correct testsolves
      are less likely to be chosen.
      We want problems that OTIS students can actually get right.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that problem proposals submitted earlier gain an advantage
    because there is more time for people to upvote it
    and more opportunities for it to be testsolved.
    Thus, submitting problems well before the deadline is advised.
  </p>
